                    <h2>BASE STEP</h2>
                    <p>This is the most important step, because it is the foundation that all my other steps will be built off of.  The first thing I do is use a big brush and big strokes to paint the silhouette shape of my subject.  3-D forms and details are not my concern during this step, interesting shape design is.  A perfect square is a boring shape to observe, but if you stretch part of it and make it lopsided, then, suddenly, the shape is interesting to look at.  Once I'm happy with my silhouette, I use a slightly darker tone to start blocking in my subject's facial features.</p>

                    <h2>STRUCTURE STEP</h2>
                    <p>Now that the foundation of the painting is set, it's time to focus on form structure.  I use a medium sized brush at this stage to block in the various head features.  Intense lighting contrast and tiny details are ignored.  My focus is on building the basic structure of 3-D forms.  This step is similar to the base step, except the focus moves from 2-D shapes to 3-D forms.  At this stage I also like to use a texture brush to introduce a little random noise to the face.</p>

                    <h2>CONTRAST STEP</h2>
                    <p>It's time to lay down some heavy contrast over these shapes and forms.  Beginner artists tend to rush, or worse, skip right to this step, because the contrast between light and shadow is alluring and makes art pop.  Though when building anything, you always want to have a strong foundation first.  Painting heavy contrast too soon will make your piece look flat and sloppy.  During this step I use my reference to find the areas of the head where the light source is most occluded.  Places like the nostrils, lip creases, eyelid folds, and so on.  I focus on building up these extra dark landmarks and work my way out from there.</p>

                    <h2>DETAIL STEP</h2>
                    <p>Think of this step as the icing on a cake.  If I showed patience and respect to all of the previous steps, then I'm ready to focus on the little details.  It can be surprising to witness how quickly hair becomes realistic looking after adding a few thin strand lines over the previously built up forms.  I make my brush as small as needed, zoom in to my painting as close as I desire, and take all the time I want with this step.  However always remember that the reference photo is just a guide, so it's up to the artist to decide how detailed the portrait should be.</p>

                    <h2>POLISH STEP</h2>
                    <p>Now we've reached the final step.  The goal here is to clean up and finalize all the work I've put into the painting so far.  I zoom out from my portrait and observe the areas that need a bit more love and care.  Maybe I put a bit too much contrast and detail in one spot and now it's drawing the eye away from my intended focal point.  I'm essentially softening up some areas and punching up others.  Unlike the detail step, the polish step requires me to zoom out often and observe the painting as a whole.  This final step is what people will notice the most, so I slow down and focus on bringing some balance and harmony to the entire piece.</p>
