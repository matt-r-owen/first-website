                <h1>HIDDEN STEPS</h1>
                <p>A casual observer of a portrait painting will only see the final step in the artist's process.  If they choose to delve deeper into the method, they will notice several important steps which the artist took along the way.  I created this website to reveal the seemingly hidden steps I take when producing a painting.  My aim is to dispel the flawed notion that art only comes from those born with "talent", and, hopefully, inspire you to create your own art too.</p>
                <p>I will be using the digital portrait painting on the right to demonstrate my method.  It was painted in an iPad app known as Procreate.  For my reference I used a photo from Pinterest.  I recommend you use a quality photo reference.  Preferably a photo with a 3/4 viewing angle, a high resolution, and an obvious light source.  You may have noticed that I played around with my subject's head and facial proportions quite a bit, because it's fun to exercise some "artistic license" from time to time.  Don't be a slave to your photo reference, it's simply a guide for when you get lost.</p>
